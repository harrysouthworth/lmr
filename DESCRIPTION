Description: Mostly simple wrappers around functions from robustbase, MASS, RobStatTM and FRB, just
  for convenience. Also provided is an anova function (another wrapper) and an rfpe function (mostly
  copied and pasted). The reason is to get all the functionality in one place, with default settings
  that I almost always want to use: Pena-Yohai initial values, MM-estimation with bisquare weight
  functions and 85% efficiency.
